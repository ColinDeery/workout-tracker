## Description

Workout Tracker is a web app to help schedule and track workouts in order to meet users’ fitness goals. A lot of us struggle to keep up with exercising – especially when busy with work, school, or even a coding bootcamp! A fitness app was personally appealing and useful to all of us, and presented opportunities to try out diverse layouts and functionality while exploring and meeting acceptance criteria. This project was built using node.js, express.js, express-handlebars, mysql, day.js, Chart.js and sequelize. We utilized data from the Api Ninjas excercise api.
